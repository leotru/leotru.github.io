## ✨ About

I am **Leonardo Trujillo**, a physicist and researcher in **applied mathematics and complex systems**, currently based in Lyon, France.  
My research focuses on the **mechanistic modeling of biological systems**, with emphasis on:

- 🧬 Biomathematics and biotechnology  
- 🔄 Dynamical systems and exact mean-field reductions  
- 🧠 Computational neuroscience and neuronal plasticity  

This website serves as a hub for my **research activities**, **teaching projects**, and my blog section *Café Léo* ☕ — a space for sharing news and views on science, mathematics, and education.
