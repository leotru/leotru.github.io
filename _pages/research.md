### 🦠 Modelling microbiological adaptation in extreme environments

My research focuses on the development of mechanistic mathematical models to understand how archaeal cells adapt to extreme environments. The project combines membrane biophysics with intracellular regulatory dynamics, using tools from nonlinear dynamical systems and partial differential equations to capture processes across spatial and temporal scales.

By explicitly coupling physical constraints with regulatory mechanisms, the models aim to provide predictive insights into the conditions that allow membrane homeostasis and cellular viability to be maintained, lost, or dynamically recovered.

A central challenge lies in formalizing the dynamical interplay between membrane properties and regulatory circuits. Tackling this problem is essential for building a unified understanding of archaeal adaptation under stress, and for explaining complex cellular behaviors such as plasticity, resilience, and evolutionary strategies.

This integrative framework is designed to bridge experimental observations from the M2E team with predictive modeling, ultimately enabling a quantitative exploration of living matter under extreme conditions.

### External collaborations

🧠 **Adaptive neural networks.** A theoretical neuroscience project focused on studying neuronal plasticity models through analytical tools from mathematical physics. The goal is to explore how neurons change and reorganise in response to learning and experience. By employing advanced mathematical physics techniques, this project seeks to gain a deeper understanding of neuronal plasticity processes, ultimately aiming to derive a learning rule that incorporates key characteristics for simulating synaptic activity in a spiking neural network model. The specific objective is to model the connectivity structure of the dorsal striatum, allowing the characterisation of its dynamics and responses to inputs associated with fast learning.
