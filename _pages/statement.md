# My Statement on Diversity, Inclusion, and Latin American Identity 

Science has always been, to me, a universal languageâ€”one that can be spoken with different accents, rhythms, and stories. My own story carries the voice of Latin America, with all its contradictions, struggles, and creativity. Preserving that identity is not about separating myself from others, but about enriching the collective conversation that happens when people from different cultures sit together around the same table of knowledge.

I believe **diversity is not an extra valueâ€”it is the heart of discovery**. Every colleague brings a different way of looking at problems, shaped by personal journeys, family histories, and cultural roots. That mosaic is what makes science alive, resilient, and beautiful.

As a  Latin American ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡ª in Europe ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º, I carry the responsibility of making sure that our voice is heard: **the voice of communities that have often been underrepresented in academia**, yet have endless talent and stories to tell. I want to show that multiculturality is not just coexistenceâ€”it is the spark that ignites creativity âœ¨.

In practice, this means:
- Welcoming colleagues as they are, with their languages, their traditions, and **their ways of celebrating life** ðŸŽ¶ + ðŸŒž.
- Standing firmly **against any form of discrimination or injustice**.
- Encouraging young people, especially from Latin America and other underrepresented regions, **to dream of a place in science**.
- Keeping my **science open and accessible**, so that **knowledge does not stop at borders**.

This is not a finished declarationâ€”just like I am not finished as a person or a scientist. It is a commitment that grows as I learn, fail, and try again. My Latin American identity is not something I leave behind; it is the compass I carry with me as I walk in a multicultural world of science.
