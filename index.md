## 🤗 Hello, world! 🌎
I am Leo Trujillo, an Associate Professor at the [Institute national des sciences appliquées de Lyon (INSA)](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/fr) 🏛️, a French grande école and engineering school situated in La Doua – LyonTech campus.
🎓 I teach mathematical modeling in the [Department of Biotechnology and bioinformatics](https://biotech-bioinfo.insa-lyon.fr/fr). 💻 📚 ✍🏻 I conduct my research within the [M2E Team (Microbiology of Extreme Environments)](https://map.insa-lyon.fr/fr/content/microbiologie-environnements-extremes) at the [Laboratory of Microbiology, Adaptation and Pathogenesis (MAP) – UMR-5240](https://map.insa-lyon.fr/fr).


## Highlights
- New research project on living matter in extreme environments.
- Starting a new project on mechanistic modelling of biological systems. 
- Ongoing research on adaptive neural networks and synaptic plasticity.
- Mathematical physics methods for next-generation neural mass models.
- Open-source code and course materials.

## My roots as a contribution
*I see science as a universal language enriched by diverse voices. My Latin American identity is part of that richness, and I believe multiculturality is not just coexistence—it is the spark that makes creativity possible*. [Read my full statement →](/statement/)
