## Modeling How Local Interactions Spark Synchronization in Complex Systems

In our latest work at Inria‚Äôs AISTROSIGHT team, we developed a particle-based modeling framework inspired by fluid dynamics to explore how coupled oscillators synchronize across space. Using this approach, we found that even in a perfectly uniform system, local interactions can spontaneously create clusters of synchronized activity ‚Äî a process that mirrors patterns seen in neural networks, ecosystems, power grids, and other spatially extended systems.

## How Evolving Disorder and Chaos Boost the Speed of Elastic Waves

In our recent work, we explored how temporal changes in the structure of complex materials can accelerate the propagation of elastic waves. By comparing materials with static disorder (spatial irregularities that remain fixed) to those with evolving disorder (irregularities that change in both space and time), we found that the latter can significantly increase wave speed. Surprisingly, we also discovered that this speed enhancement is not limited to random fluctuations ‚Äî even deterministic chaotic evolution of the medium can produce the same effect. These findings open new perspectives on wave transport in complex media, with implications for physics, engineering, and materials science.

## The Hidden Role of Chromosomal Rearrangements in Long-Term Adaptation

In our recent study, we used *Aevol*, a forward-in-time simulation platform, to investigate how chromosomal rearrangements shape evolutionary dynamics compared to local mutations. By evolving populations under different mutation regimes ‚Äî from simple substitutions to combinations including insertions, deletions, and chromosomal rearrangements ‚Äî we discovered that these large-scale genomic changes, though rarely fixed in lineages, have a decisive long-term impact. They not only accelerate the expansion of gene repertoires through duplication but also mitigate diminishing-returns epistasis, helping sustain adaptation over time. Moreover, they indirectly regulate genome size by promoting reproductive robustness. These findings highlight the often invisible yet fundamental role of chromosomal rearrangements in evolution.

## Escaping Local Fitness Peaks with Inversion Mutations

In this work, we explored how structural mutations ‚Äî specifically sequence inversions ‚Äî can open new evolutionary paths in rugged fitness landscapes. Using the NK model, we simulated adaptive walks under the strong selection weak mutation regime, comparing the effects of point mutations and inversions. Our results show that, while point mutations often trap evolution on local fitness peaks, inversion mutations allow lineages to escape these traps and reach higher adaptive peaks. By representing accessible genotypes as graphs, we visualized how inversions reveal otherwise unreachable regions of the landscape. This simple mechanistic model offers new insight into the role of structural mutations in molecular evolution and the limitations of point-mutation-only models.

## Intrinsic Uncertainty from Autonomous Choices in Deterministic Chaos

In this study, we investigated a family of one-dimensional dynamical systems that autonomously choose among different deterministic evolution rules as they evolve. We showed that some hyperchaotic sequences are in fact closed-form expressions of the orbits of these pseudo-random systems. Each system in this family exhibits extreme sensitivity to initial conditions, where unpredictability arises not only from the evolution law itself but also from the sequence of rule choices. This work opens the door to extending current theories of complex behavior by incorporating the concept of intrinsic uncertainty within deterministic chaos.
