# Should We Continue Training Biotechnologists? The Urgency of a Science in the Service of Life

*By Leonardo Trujillo*

---

In a world where headlines bombard us with climate crises, biodiversity loss, and unprecedented pollution, an uncomfortable question arises for those of us dedicated to scientific education: **Should we continue training students in biotechnology, a discipline that, in the wrong hands, can cause more harm than good to the environment?** The answer is not simple, but it is urgent. It is not about stopping science, but about **radically reorienting it** towards a purpose that prioritizes life over profit, and precaution over unbridled ambition.

### **Biotechnology: A Tool of Liberation or Destruction?**

Biotechnology, like any technology, is not intrinsically good or bad. Its impact depends on **who controls it** and **for what purposes**. On one hand, it has the potential to offer critical solutions:
- **Bioremediation** of soils and waters contaminated by decades of industrialization.
- **Development of biomaterials** to replace petroleum-based plastics.
- **Accessible medicine**, such as the production of insulin or gene therapies with a smaller ecological footprint.
- **Resilient agriculture**, with crops adapted to droughts or degraded soils, **without agrochemicals**.

But on the other hand, when biotechnology is subordinated to corporate interests or the logic of "growth at any cost," it becomes a weapon of mass destruction:
- **Transgenic monocultures** that displace biodiversity and increase the dependence of rural communities on patented seeds and herbicides like glyphosate.
- **Genetic pollution** from the release of modified organisms without rigorous long-term impact studies.
- **False solutions** that perpetuate extractivism, such as biofuels that compete with food production and worsen the global food crisis.

The problem is not biotechnology itself, but the **economic and political model** that uses it to concentrate power and deepen inequalities. As educators, we have the responsibility to question this model and train scientists who **put ethics and environmental justice above corporate interests**.

---

### **The Ethical Crossroads: Continue Training or Stop?**

Given this scenario, should we continue teaching biotechnology? The answer is not "yes" or "no," but **"how."** The solution is not to abandon the discipline, but to **transform its approach** from the root. Here are some clues to achieve this:

#### **1. Teach Critical and Regenerative Biotechnology**
Future biotechnologists must understand that their work does not occur in a vacuum, but in a complex social, political, and ecological context. This implies:
- **Analyzing the limits of technology**: Do we really need a biotechnological solution, or could the problem be solved with simpler, less invasive approaches, like agroecology?
- **Evaluating social impacts**: Who benefits from this innovation? Local communities or transnational corporations?
- **Prioritizing regenerative applications**: Focusing on projects that **restore ecosystems**, such as the bioremediation of contaminated soils or the development of compostable materials.

#### **2. Incorporate Interdisciplinary Approaches**
Biotechnology cannot be taught as an isolated discipline. It must be integrated with:
- **Environmental ethics**: Courses on political ecology, climate justice, and degrowth, so that students understand the implications of their work.
- **Community participation**: Projects that arise from the real needs of communities, not from corporate interests.
- **Circular economy**: Designing processes that **close cycles**, where the waste from one system becomes inputs for another, avoiding the generation of waste.

#### **3. Question the Dominant "Innovation" Model**
It is essential to challenge the narrative that biotechnology is the "magic solution" to all problems. Instead, we must:
- **Promote precaution**: Adopt the principle that, if we are not sure of the long-term impacts, **we should not release an organism or technology into the environment**.
- **Value low-tech solutions**: Sometimes the answer is not in complex genetic manipulation, but in traditional knowledge, such as the agroecological management of soils or the use of native plants to restore ecosystems.
- **Denounce conflicts of interest**: Many universities and research centers receive funds from corporations like Monsanto/Bayer or Syngenta, which prioritize profits over the common good. Are we training independent scientists or industry employees?

#### **4. Reorient the Career Towards Environmental Justice**
If the current model of biotechnology is unsustainable, why not redefine the discipline? We could:
- **Create specializations in ecological biotechnology**, where technology serves to regenerate ecosystems instead of exploiting them.
- **Integrate traditional knowledge**, such as indigenous knowledge on seed and soil management, which has proven to be sustainable for millennia.
- **Foster ethical disobedience**: Teach students to reject harmful projects, even if they are "profitable" or "innovative."

## Examples of Biotechnology Serving Life

In France, biotechnology has been applied in innovative projects that prioritize **ecological regeneration** and the **common good**, demonstrating that it is possible to align science with environmental and social justice:

---

### 1. **Bioremediation of Contaminated Industrial Soils**
In the **Nord-Pas-de-Calais** region, a former mining and industrial area, **native bacteria and fungi** have been used to decontaminate soils affected by heavy metals (such as lead, zinc, and arsenic). These microorganisms, isolated from the soils themselves, degrade or immobilize contaminants without the need for costly excavations or aggressive chemicals. The project, developed in collaboration with **INRAE** (National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food, and Environment), has enabled the recovery of areas for agricultural and forestry use, reducing risks for local communities.

---

### 2. **Wetland Restoration Using Bioengineering**
In the **Camargue** (southern France), wetlands—critical ecosystems for biodiversity—have been restored using **native plants and microorganisms** to improve water quality and resilience to droughts. Bioengineering techniques, such as the use of **nitrogen-fixing bacteria** in plant roots, have accelerated the recovery of areas degraded by salinization and intensive agriculture. These projects, led by teams from **CIRAD** (International Center for Agricultural Research for Development), demonstrate how biotechnology can support **climate change adaptation** without relying on external inputs.

---

### 3. **Decentralized Wastewater Treatment Using Microalgae**
In cities like **Montpellier** and **Lyon**, pilot systems have been implemented using **local microalgae** to purify urban wastewater. The algae, cultivated in open bioreactors, absorb nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, reducing the need for chemical treatments. Additionally, the resulting algal biomass is used as **organic fertilizer** in peri-urban agriculture, closing the nutrient cycle. These initiatives, developed in collaboration with public universities, show how biotechnology can be integrated into **local circular economies**.

---

### 4. **Conservation of Traditional Plant Varieties**
In the **Pyrenees** and **French Alps**, projects involving **community seed banks** have used **in vitro cultivation techniques** to rescue local varieties of cereals, vegetables, and fruits at risk of extinction. These varieties, adapted to specific climatic conditions, are more resilient than industrial crops and do not depend on agrochemicals. The **Réseau Semences Paysannes** (Peasant Seeds Network) has worked with public laboratories to multiply these seeds and distribute them among farmers, strengthening **food sovereignty** and agricultural biodiversity.

---

### 5. **Biogas Production from Agricultural Waste**
In regions like **Brittany** and **Normandy**, agricultural cooperatives have developed **anaerobic digestion systems** using crop residues and manure to produce biogas. This process not only generates renewable energy but also produces a **digestate** (organic residue) used as fertilizer, reducing dependence on natural gas and synthetic fertilizers. The projects, driven by **citizen energy cooperatives**, demonstrate that biotechnology can be a tool for **just and decentralized energy transition**.

---

### **Key Lessons**
These French examples show that biotechnology can be **regenerative** when:
- It is based on **local resources** (microorganisms, plants, or available waste in the region).
- It prioritizes **collaboration with communities** and public actors (not private corporations).
- It seeks to **close cycles** (water, nutrients, energy) instead of generating waste or dependencies.
- It focuses on **decentralized solutions**, tailored to specific contexts.

Biotechnology, when disconnected from commercial interests and integrated into **natural and social ecosystems**, can be a powerful ally in addressing environmental challenges **without repeating past mistakes**.
